Sherlock is a program that seeks for file duplicates and removes them. It is meant for simplicity of use, and therefore is simple by design.

Simply drag the ```Sherlock.exe``` into the desired folder, then execute the program.

You can also use the command line to directly pass the desired directory path.

From command line
```shell
./Sherlock.exe example/path/
```
